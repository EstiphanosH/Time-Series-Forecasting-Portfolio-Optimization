## **🚀 Overview**

This repository provides a comprehensive, end-to-end analytics engine designed to enhance portfolio management at GMF Investments. It moves beyond traditional analysis by integrating **time series forecasting** with **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to deliver forward-looking, optimized investment strategies.

The entire platform is built on MLOps best practices, ensuring that every analysis is **robust, reproducible, and ready for production deployment.**

## **✨ Core Features**

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Technology Stack                                                                |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** | A user-friendly web application for real-time scenario analysis, portfolio optimization, and backtesting without writing a single line of code.                               | `Streamlit`, `Plotly`                                                           |
| 🔮 **Predictive Forecasting**  | Utilizes an `ARIMA` model to generate statistically-grounded forecasts of asset performance, providing a forward-looking edge over historical-only analysis.             | `pmdarima`, `statsmodels`                                                       |
| ⚖️ **Efficient Optimization** | Applies Modern Portfolio Theory to calculate the optimal asset allocation for maximizing risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) based on the forecast.                  | `PyPortfolioOpt`                                                                |
| ⏪ **Dynamic Backtesting**   | Simulates strategy performance with realistic, periodic rebalancing to validate the effectiveness of the model-driven portfolio against industry benchmarks.               | `pandas`, `numpy`                                                               |
| 📦 **Containerized & Reproducible** | The entire application is packaged in a **Docker** container, guaranteeing a consistent and error-free environment on any machine, from an analyst's laptop to the cloud. | `Docker`                                                                        |
| 🔬 **Experiment Tracking**     | Every model training run is logged with **MLflow**, creating a full audit trail of parameters, performance metrics, and model artifacts for governance and comparison.   | `MLflow`                                                                        |
| 🛡️ **Automated CI/CD**         | A **GitHub Actions** workflow automatically tests, lints, and validates all code changes, ensuring the platform remains stable, reliable, and high-quality.               | `GitHub Actions`, `pytest`, `flake8`                                             |

## **⚡ Quickstart: Running the Interactive Dashboard**

Get the most powerful feature of this platform running in under 60 seconds.

**Prerequisites:** You must have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<Your-Username>/<Your-Repo>.git
    cd <Your-Repo>
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    This command packages the entire application. It only needs to be run once.
    ```bash
    docker build -t portfolio-optimizer .
    ```

3.  **Launch the Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 portfolio-optimizer streamlit run dashboard/app.py
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**.

You can now interactively build and test portfolio strategies.

## **🛠️ For Developers & Analysts**

While the dashboard is the primary interface, developers and analysts can leverage the full suite of tools for deeper research and automated analysis.

### **Local Environment Setup**

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install all dependencies
make install
```

### **Workflow Commands**

This project uses a `Makefile` to provide simple, memorable commands for common tasks.

| Command             | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `make run`          | Executes the entire automated pipeline (data -> model -> reports) from the command line.                |
| `make notebook`     | Launches the JupyterLab environment for deep-dive exploratory analysis in the `/notebooks` directory.     |
| `make test`         | Runs the complete quality assurance suite: formats code with `black`, lints with `flake8`, and runs unit tests with `pytest`. |
| `make clean`        | Removes all generated artifacts (reports, logs, caches) for a clean slate.                              |
| `make mlflow-ui`    | Launches the MLflow UI to browse and compare model experiments. (New command in `Makefile`)            |
